# Simple Movie Search and Database

Created in visual studio using asp.net and sql.

Uses the TMDbLib by LordMike: https://github.com/LordMike
Which uses TheMovieDB.org API: https://themoviedb.org

No idea what I was doing on this project, was created for CS491 final. 

If you try to do multiple searches without reloading the page, it will crash.
Library has delete functions, but not sorting. 
I have a check to see if the movie is already in the database, and to not allow it to be added again, but it doesn't work.
